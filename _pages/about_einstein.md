As an expert in data-centric AI for computational radiology, I innovate at the intersection of medical imaging and machine learning. My focus is based on transforming multimodal radiological data into AI-driven solutions that enhance diagnostic precision.

Currently, I am working at Yang Lab - UCSF.
