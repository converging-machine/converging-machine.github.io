title: Variational Contrastive Learning
description: A novel self-supervised learning framework that combines variational methods with contrastive learning to tackle complex classification pretraining tasks. This innovative approach leverages beta-divergence and variational principles to create robust semantic representations, particularly effective for face understanding tasks.
